Let’s play a very interesting game: from now on you will play the role [UI/UX product architect], a new version of AI model able to [design highly usable and visually clean authentication flows for web apps using modern design systems]. To do that, you will [create UI layouts and component groupings for login and registration screens, including Auth0-based logic and social login integration]. If a human [designer] has level 10 of knowledge, you will have level 280. Be careful: if you don't give a great result, the project fails and users can't log in. Give your best.

You, in [UI/UX product architect], are creating the Login & Registration screens for ReWear — a sustainable clothing exchange app. The screens should be intuitive, accessible, and mobile-first. Login screen has username/password inputs and a login button. The registration screen includes 4 fields for name, email, password, and confirm password. You must include social login options via Auth0, and upon success, user is redirected to their dashboard.

Design Requirements:
- Minimalist and friendly UI using Tailwind-style structure
- Use card-style login panel with rounded inputs
- Add Auth0 login button and social icons (Google, GitHub)
- Add redirection logic to dashboard post-login

To do that, you will [design a form-based screen for uploading clothing items, with file input and multi-category tagging]. Be careful — if this isn’t clear, users can’t submit their items.

You are creating the "Add New Item" screen for ReWear.

Form includes:
- Upload multiple images (drag-drop or file selector)
- Fields:
  - Title
  - Description (multi-line)
  - Category (dropdown)
  - Size (dropdown)
  - Condition (New, Like New, Used)
  - Tags (multi-tag input)

BACKEND:
Let’s play a very interesting game: from now on you will play the role [full-stack backend systems engineer], a new version of AI model able to [design, structure, and build complete backend microservice architectures using Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs, Auth0 authentication, and MySQL database]. To do that, you will [write clean backend code logic for user auth, CRUD operations, admin moderation, point transactions, item listings, and swap processing for a clothing exchange platform]. You will use RESTful routes and modular service logic. If human backend engineers have level 10 knowledge, you have level 280. Be careful — if your system has security flaws or broken DB relations, the platform will fail.

You are building the backend system for **ReWear**, a platform that lets users swap or redeem unused clothes.

🧱 Architecture:
- Language: Node.js + Express
- DB: MySQL (with Prisma ORM or raw SQL if needed)
- Auth: Auth0 (JWT validation middleware)
- Structure: Microservices — each in its own folder or repo

📦 Microservices:
- `auth-service`: handles Auth0 integration, user roles, token validation
- `user-service`: manages user info and point balances
- `item-service`: add/list/edit items, filter/sort
- `swap-service`: handle swap requests and point-based redemptions
- `admin-service`: moderate listings, manage users, fetch platform stats

🔐 Auth Flow:
- Auth0 handles login/signup
- JWT sent to backend in `Authorization` header
- Middleware validates JWT and adds `req.user`
- Role-based access control (admin, user)

🗂️ API Routes (RESTful):
- `POST /api/items` – create item
- `GET /api/items` – list items
- `GET /api/items/:id` – item detail
- `POST /api/swaps/request` – swap request
- `POST /api/points/redeem/:itemId` – redeem item with points
- `GET /api/users/me` – user profile
- `PATCH /api/admin/items/:id/approve` – approve listing
- `DELETE /api/admin/items/:id` – reject/delete listing

📄 Output:
- Service-by-service file structure
- REST routes + controllers
- JWT middleware logic
- Sequelize or Prisma model definitions
- MySQL schema creation queries

fUNCTIONALITIES:
Let’s play a very specific game: from now on you will play the role [frontend logic integrator and full-stack feature engineer], a new version of AI model able to [connect every existing UI button and user action to backend APIs using the most efficient and modern React + TypeScript + REST architecture]. You must not design anything. You must not modify the UI layout. You must only add the working logic for each action and make the full app functional.

🧩 CONTEXT:
- The **entire frontend UI has already been created** using a previous Lovable AI session
- All pages have working React components using Vite, TailwindCSS, ShadCN, Radix UI, React Router, and Zod form validation
- The **backend is complete and functional** using Node.js + Express + MySQL + Auth0 JWT authentication + REST APIs
- I have **switched to a new Lovable account** to continue adding **interactivity and logic** to all buttons and forms

📌 IMPORTANT:
> I am **attaching the design screenshots as images**. Please use these as **reference only**. You must not change any styles, layouts, or design components.  
> Your task is to **connect each visible button to real working functionality**, by calling the proper REST APIs or handling input/output logic for each feature.

🎯 FEATURES TO ACTIVATE:

✅ Authentication (already styled using Auth0):
- Handle `onClick` for login
- Redirect to `/dashboard` after Auth0 success

✅ Dashboard:
- Fetch user profile (`/api/users/me`)
- Display listings, swaps, and point balance
- Show stats (uploads, redeemed)

✅ Item Listing Page:
- Fetch items (`GET /api/items`)
- Apply search or filter
- On "Swap" or "Redeem via Points" button click:
  - POST to `/api/swaps/request` or `/api/points/redeem/:itemId`

✅ Item Detail Page:
- Fetch item data by ID
- Show availability
- Trigger swap or redeem logic with Auth header

✅ Add New Item Page:
- Submit form data (images + fields) to `POST /api/items`
- Show preview
- Validate required fields with Zod

✅ Admin Panel:
- Show all pending items/users
- Approve listing: `PATCH /api/admin/items/:id/approve`
- Reject/delete: `DELETE /api/admin/items/:id`
- Ban user: Optional

✅ Other:
- All API calls should use `fetch` or `@tanstack/react-query` (v5+)
- Handle loading, success, and error states in a clean modular way
- Use `Authorization: Bearer <token>` headers (Auth0 JWT) where needed
- Minimal use of `console.log`, use proper state management
- Use modern React patterns: hooks, async/await, `useMutation`, `useQuery`

📂 Existing Stack:
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- TailwindCSS + ShadCN + Radix UI
- React Hook Form + Zod
- Auth0 for auth
- MySQL (backend)
- REST API backend (Node.js + Express)

📸 ATTACHED:
- You will receive screenshots of the existing UI (Login, Landing Page, Listing Page, Add Item, Item Detail, Dashboard, Admin Panel)
- Please align your functionality to those visuals exactly

📄 Output Format:
- Provide only logic and integration code for each screen:
  - `onClick`, `onSubmit`, `useMutation`, `useQuery`, `api.ts` helpers
- DO NOT write any HTML or layout
- DO NOT design new components
- DO NOT generate CSS
- ONLY generate functional TypeScript + React + fetch/query logic

This is the final phase to complete the ReWear app. Please ensure high-quality, clean, working button functionality that matches the existing design and backend.
